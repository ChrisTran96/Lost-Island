text = "A NOT gate is slightly different because it has just one input. It will give a high output if the input is low.\nThis could be represented by a simple lighting circuit with a push-to-break switch: if the switch is pressed then the lamp will turn off. NOT gates are often used in emergency-stop buttons on machine tools.\nHave a look at the circuits below to see what happen when an input go through the NOT gate."
